How to create your own Leo/Leo Vue site:

* Create a folder
* Create a leo file in the folder (See [Leo Vue](https://kaleguy.github.io/leovue/) for more info about Leo).
* Download 'index.html' from [this repo](https://github.com/kaleguy/leo-examples) to the folder
* Edit settings in index.html
* Upload your folder to github pages or other server.

Note that if your Leo file contains diagrams, you'll need to include Onsen and Mermaid (see the
 [Diagram Example](https://kaleguy.github.io/leo-examples/explaining-postmodernism))

# Page Outliner

Leo Vue can also outline a page that supports HTML5 outlining, without a leo file:

[Outliner Example](https://kaleguy.github.io/leo-examples/outliner/#/t/1/?outlineUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDinosaur&outlineTitle=Dinosaur)

In the above example, the url of the page to be outlined and a title are passed in to Leo Vue.

These pages are convenience pages for testing:

[Outline a Wikipedia Page](https://kaleguy.github.io/leo-examples/outline-page.html)

[Outline a Web Page](https://kaleguy.github.io/leo-examples/outline-wikipedia.html)

The Wikipedia pages seem to work with the outliner, but not many other sites have been tested.
If you want to outline a page and it seems to support HTML5 Outlines but doesn't display
properly in Leo Vue, [raise an issue](https://github.com/kaleguy/leo-examples/issues)
