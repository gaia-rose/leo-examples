Note, the page outliner is currently not supported due to unreliability of the target html structure.

This will be reworked in the future.

# Page Outliner

Leo Vue can also outline a page that supports HTML5 outlining, without a leo file:

[Outliner Example](https://kaleguy.github.io/leo-examples/outliner/#/t/1/?outlineUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDinosaur&outlineTitle=Dinosaur)

In the above example, the url of the page to be outlined and a title are passed in to Leo Vue.

These pages are convenience pages for testing:

[Outline a Wikipedia Page](https://kaleguy.github.io/leo-examples/outliner/outline-wikipedia.html)

[Outline a Web Page](https://kaleguy.github.io/leo-examples/outliner/outline-page.html)

The Wikipedia pages seem to work with the outliner, but not many other sites have been tested.
If you want to outline a page and it seems to support HTML5 Outlines but doesn't display
properly in Leo Vue, [raise an issue](https://github.com/kaleguy/leo-examples/issues)
